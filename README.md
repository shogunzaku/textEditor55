 #(PWA): Text Editor

  ## Description
 My task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

 ## Installation
  to install the dependencies for this project, the user simply needs to clone the repository and then run the command "npm install". This will install all necessary dependencies since they are all included in the package.json. 
  
  ## Usage
  To use this app, simply open it up in the browser (with the deployed app link at the top of this readme) and then you are good to go. For offline use, the user can go to the link and hit the "install" button at the top left corner of the page.
